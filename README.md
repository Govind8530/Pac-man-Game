# Pac-man-Game
A fun, browser-based Pac-Man clone built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates the core mechanics of the classic arcade game, where Pac-Man navigates a maze, eats pellets, avoids ghosts, and scores points.
HTML – Structure of the game layout and game board.

CSS – Styling of the maze, characters (Pac-Man & Ghosts), and UI.

JavaScript – Game logic, movement mechanics, collision detection, scoring, and animation.
